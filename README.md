[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qmlividqhxnukl9s/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tomdodd4598/ucl-phas0100-cmakelibraryandapp)

Purpose
-------

This is a demo project to provide a more advanced [CMake](https://cmake.org/) example
that creates two libraries and a command line app. As with [CMakeHellowWorld](https://github.com/MattClarkson/CMakeHelloWorld)
this is only a toy teaching example, and not suitable for real world use. Its just a teaching aid.
